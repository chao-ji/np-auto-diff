class Node(object):
  """The base class of all Node types that a computational graph is composed of.
  A Node instance holds the forward pass value and backward pass value (i.e. the
  gradient, with the same shape as the forward pass value) of a tensor-valued 
  variable in a computational graph.

  To kick off the forward and backward pass, call `self.forward()` and 
  `self.backward`, respectively. 

  Subclasses (i.e. specific node types) must implement the abstract methods
  `_forward()` and `_backward()`. They define the subclass-specific logic to 
  carry out the forward and backward pass, and they are called internally by 
  `forward()` and `backward()`.
  

  The example below explains the logic to be implemented in `_forward()` 
  and `_backward()`. Suppose there is a computational graph,

  a = b + c
  d = a * 1
  e = a^2
  
  where `a` consumes values of `b` and `c` -- `a` is a *consumer* of `b` and 
  `c`, and `b` and `c` each is an *argument* of `a`. Similary, `d` and `e` are 
  *consumers* of `a`, of which `a` is an *argument*.

  The `_forward()` method of `a` must implement the addition operation, which 
  asks for the values of `b` and `c` by calling `b.forward()` and `c.forward()`.

  In the backward pass, `a`'s gradient value is first computed by calling 
  `a.backward(da_d_val)` and `a.backward(da_e_val)` in the `_backward()` method
   of `d` and `e`, where `da_d_val` and `da_e_val` are the gradient w.r.t. `a` 
  that goes through `d` and `e`. Note that the order does not matter, because 
  `a`'s gradient is simply accumulated.

  Given `a`'s full gradient value `grad_val` (i.e. the accumulation of gradient
  from `d` and `e`) computed, the `_backward()` method of `a` computes `db_val` 
  and `dc_val`, i.e. the gradient w.r.t. `b` and `c`, and backprops them by 
  calling `b.backward(db_val)` amd `c.backward(dc_val)`, respectively.
